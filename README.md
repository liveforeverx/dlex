# Dlex

Dlex is a gRPC based client for the [Dgraph](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph) database in Elixir.
It uses the [DBConnection](https://hexdocs.pm/db_connection/DBConnection.html) behaviour to support
transactions and connection pooling.

Small, efficient codebase. Aims for a full Dgraph support. Supports transactions (starting from Dgraph version: `1.0.9`),
delete mutations and low-level parameterized queries. DSL is planned.

Now supports the new dgraph 1.1.x [Type System](https://docs.dgraph.io/master/query-language/#type-system). 

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `dlex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

Preffered and more performant option is to use `grpc`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:jason, "~> 1.0"},
    {:dlex, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

`http` transport:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:jason, "~> 1.0"},
    {:castore, "~> 0.1.0", optional: true},
    {:mint, github: "ericmj/mint", branch: "master"},
    {:dlex, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage example

```elixir
{:ok, conn} = Dlex.start_link(name: :example) # default try to connect `localhost:9080` by default
Dlex.alter!(conn, %{drop_all: true})
{:ok, _} = Dlex.alter(conn, "name: string @index(term) .")
{:ok, %{"uid" => uid}} = Dlex.mutate(conn, %{
  "name" => "Alice",
  "friends" => [%{"name" => "Betty"}, %{"name" => "Mark"}]
}, return_json: true) # return the same json with uids
Dlex.mutate(conn, ~s|_:foo <name> "Bar" .|) # or in nquads format
by_name = "query by_name($name: string) {by_name(func: eq(name, $name)) {uid expand(_all_)}}"
Dlex.query(conn, by_name, %{"$name" => "Betty"})
Dlex.delete(conn, %{"uid" => uid}) # delete Alice node
```

### Alter schema

Modification of schema supported with string and map form (which is returned by `query_schema`):

```
Dlex.alter(conn, "name: string @index(term, fulltext, trigram) @lang .")
# equivalent to in map form
Dlex.alter(conn, [
  %{
    "predicate" => "name",
    "type" => "string",
    "index" => true,
    "lang" => true,
    "tokenizer" => ["term", "fulltext", "trigram"]
  }
])
```

## Developers guide

### By updating api.proto

#### Install development dependencies

1. Install `protoc`(cpp) [here](https://github.com/google/protobuf/blob/master/src/README.md) or `brew install protobuf` on MacOS.
2. Install protoc plugin `protoc-gen-elixir` for Elixir . NOTE: You have to make sure `protoc-gen-elixir`(this name is important) is in your PATH.

```bash
mix escript.install hex protobuf
```

#### By updating [api.proto](https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgo/blob/master/protos/api.proto), generate Elixir code

3. Generate Elixir code using protoc

```bash
protoc --elixir_out=plugins=grpc:. lib/api.proto
```

4. Files `lib/api.pb.ex` will be generated

5. Rename `lib/api.pb.ex` to `lib/dlex/api.ex` and add `alias Dlex.Api` to be complient with Elixir naming

## Credits

Inspired by [exdgraph](https://github.com/ospaarmann/exdgraph), but as I saw too many parts for changes or parts, which I would like to have completely different, so that it was easier to start from scratch with these goals: small codebase, small natural abstraction, efficient, less opionated, less dependencies.

So you can choose freely which pool implementation to use (poolboy or db_connection intern pool implementation) or
which JSON adapter to use. Fewer dependencies.

It seems for me more natural to have API names more or less matching actual query names.

For example `Dlex.mutate()` instead of `ExDgraph.set_map` for JSON-based mutations. Actually, `Dlex.mutate` infers
the type (JSON or nquads) from data passed to a function.
